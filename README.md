# newElixirStart
Starting again with elixir after a long break.
Battleships game is based on "Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix" by Lance Halvorsen.
I made small changes for now because some time has passed since publishing the book.

What's left is to create frontend to see the changes in game
